# Specification in Pencil2D

## Introduction

Remitting the first document created under the ESOF scope, "Software Processes",
the "Specifications" topic has already been briefly touched. An important reference to
the project specification that will be
[attached here too](http://www.pencil2d.org/2010/06/the-vision-for-pencil-by-pascal-naidon/)
 was also given.
With that said, the present document tries go further into the details of the topic.

...write about specification in general maybe (?)
the 1st doc. Specification section already works as a good intro.
not sure if we need to repeat, so maybe something else could be added instead.

###Origin of Requirements in Pencil2d

One of the main figures of the original pencil project states that this is a personal
 non-profit oriented project that is open for other people to develop and use. This creates a sort of 
 duality in the analysis because we can access the pencil2d requirements from
 different perspectives.
 It's possible to think of "pencil2d", referring to the overall software ramifications like
 forks like bluepencil and not to the actual project, as a software which specification arises
 from the intersections between public demands and developers self set goals.
 It is also possible to think of "pencil2d" in the context of it's origins or individually or
 in context of the public demand for such a application.
 We will try to approach the "main branch perspective" where we can consider the initial stated requirements (original pencil)
 and it's new iteration (current pencil2d) requirements according to the public contribution.

Pencil2D, the project, started from one of these intersections by picking up a existing project, pencil, and giving it continuity.
 After that, specifications may have been refined and slightly changed by the public contribution and feedback. It's possible 
 that some requirements are only specified in some branch/fork and after a merge the main
 project assimilates the result without having to make "side" specifications.
 
 
 ###Pencil Requirements/Specifications

There is some documentation on [requirements that dates from the original pencil project on the pencil2d website](http://www.pencil2d.org/2010/06/the-vision-for-pencil-by-pascal-naidon/).
<br>The documentation clarifies the motives and aspirations behind Pencil and tries to establish future direction to the project, according to the original developer believe "that 
an application like Pencil should be designed with some personal vision and goal to remain effective".
<br>From it we see that there was no entity besides main developers working on pencil at the time that functions as stakeholder, and since the project is being continued
 by new developers we can take this documentation as being the current Pencil2d's first requirement elicitation that establishes the initial objectives.

The exposed requirements are mainly user and system related. The project already presumes the use of c++ in the development since it is using the Qt framework
 and software requirements are not the main focus although they are briefly touched.
<br>Being done by the main developers some "technical" requirements related to the application functionality may have been easier to assert due too the understanding of the topics
 and the already established project vision. The clarity of these specifications seems to confirm this. 
<br>In regards to internal quality and software requirements it's referred modular design in future development (future at the time of the documentation) of
 Pencil to allow the implementation of secondary usages but it doesn't expand much beyond that. There are presented some "paper" prototypes of 
 these modules and how they should appear to the user and then some considerations about their integration (or not) into a main application but nothing stays explicitly defined or planned.

## some rand thoughts and links

(??? need a 2nd opinion on these)

The dynamic nature of the development, like the change of main developers in the transition from Pencil to Pencil2d  or the already mentioned in "Software Development.md" incremental development process,
 may introduce a volatility problem . In the context of a long term development of an open-source project it's more questionable whether this just part of the project's nature and
 not necessarily a problem since public feedback from users or other developers is usually present and technology evolves over time.
 
 The more recent requirements seem more related to fix bugs or "clean" code than changing the original requirements
 (so they appear to be fixing
 something that failed in the development or in the initial requirements.
 conjecture quality requirements
