# Software Evolution in Pencil2D

## Introduction

Software evolution is the process through each software changes in order to meet new requirements. This is necessary so that software products remain useful and in harmony with its environment.

Of course, with software products being more and more complex, this evolution is typically expensive and difficult. But it is still a necessary evil, one cannot simply reinvent the wheel every time.

There are specific processes that should be used for software evolution. Although we do not go into detail about these processes, as they are related to software creation processes, we note the importance of impact analysis. 

##Feature Evolution in Pencil2D

Pencil2D is a work in progress and, as such, it has room for many improvements. Many of these improvements are for error correcting. But there is also considerable public demand for feature addition or evolution.

As part of our assignment, we decided to improve the slider for tool sizes. This slider allows the user to user to change the size of the brushes, erasers, etc, that are being used to draw. Our update lets the user choose between a logarithmic scale and the normal scale that was already implemented.

Even though it seems like a simple change, since the project already possesses a decent degree of complexity, and we were not involved in its creation or development, it was not easy to reach the desired goal. Our main method was to observe similar features and their respective code. There was also some research involved, since we are not familiar with the Qt language.

In the end, we managed to obtain the desired result, and to the best of our tests, nothing else was broken.

## Conclusion

This project allowed us to obtain some practice in what is probably going to be the future for many of us. Indeed, we are very likely to end up working on some software whose origin we did not witness. It would not be uncommon for that software to be poorly documented. This means some reverse engineering will be necessary as was the case with our work on Pencil2D.

This last part of actually trying to make changes to the software was particularly challenging but also rewarding, since it gave us a change to put in practice what we learned in the course.
