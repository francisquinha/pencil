### Component Diagram

This project uses external libraries whose main focus is to read from and write to ZIP archives. It is provided by the component QuaZIP, QuaZIP allows the access to files inside ZIP archives using QIODevice API (contained from the Qt Framework).
The Qt framework provides the graphical interface that is going to support the visualization of the canvas. Basically it is the interface between the user and the software.
